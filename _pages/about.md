**Actively Seeking full-time research or machine-learning roles** !!

Hello ! I'm currently in my final year of graduate studies, pursuing a Master's degree in Language Technologies at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) within the School of Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](www.cmu.edu). I have the privilege of being advised by [Eric Nyberg](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/), a distinguished professor in the field.

My passion lies in harnessing the practical potential of NLP research and bridging the gaps that hinder the development of effective language-based solutions. During my time at LTI, I got to explore a bunch of NLP topics and learned about the challenges that exist in this field. My research experience so far has led me to these two broad goals to
focus on (i) developing language models that can serve as question-answering agents, catering to our complex information needs (ii) developing computationally efficient modeling methods to accomplish this goal effectively.


I am interning with [Amazon AWS Science](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) Team this summer, focusing on model compression for large language models (LLMs). Previously, I interned at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/), working on parameter-efficient modeling for Unified Question-Answering. I have experience as a Data Scientist at [Hitachi Vantara](https://www.hitachivantara.com/en-us/home.html) and hold a B.Tech. in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). During my time at IIT-Kharagpur, I was part of the [CNeRG](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/) group, collaborating with [Animesh Mukherjee](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/). Additionally, I have also worked as a research intern at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/) and [Hitachi R&D](https://www.hitachi.com/rd/index.html).

I come from [Prayagraj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayagraj) (India) known for the confluence of three ancient rivers. I enjoy collecting stamps, swimming, playing waterpolo, biking, hiking, solo traveling, and star gazing.

I am currently **actively searching for full-time opportunities** in the fields of NLP research or machine learning application. If you have any available positions, I kindly request you to reach out to me. I am best reached by email at [srijanb@andrew.cmu.edu](srijanb@andrew.cmu.edu). Feel free to reach out about my research or anything else I might be able to help with.
