Hi! I am a graduate student (Master in Langauge Technologies) at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/), at the School of Computer Science,[Carnegie Mellon University](www.cmu.edu). I am fortunate to be advised by [Eric Nyberg](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/). 

I interned at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/) this summer where I worked on parameter-efficient modeling for Unified Question-Answering. Prior to CMU, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Hitachi Vantara](https://www.hitachivantara.com/en-us/home.html). I received B.Tech. in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). I was a member of [CNeRG](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/) group at IIT-Kharagpur where I worked with [Animesh Mukherjee](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/). In the past, I have worked as a research intern at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/) and [Hitachi R&D](https://www.hitachi.com/rd/index.html).

I come from Allahabad (India) known for the confluence of three ancient rivers. I enjoy collecting stamps, swimming, playing waterpolo, biking, hiking, solo traveling, and star gazing.

More information about my work experience, publications, and academic service can be found in my [CV](https://github.com/srijan-bansal/srijan-bansal.github.io/blob/master/files/CV_Srijan_Bansal__04_23_.pdf). I am best reached by email at [srijanb@andrew.cmu.edu](srijanb@andrew.cmu.edu). Feel free to reach out about my research or anything else I might be able to help with.



<!-- 
My research focuses on machine learning and developing robust and efficient algorithms driven by clinical problems.
Applications include motion-robust 3D rendering of the human brain, real-time quality assessment in MR scans as well as pose estimation and motion characterization of fetuses.
I am advised by Prof. [Elfar Adalsteinsson](https://www.rle.mit.edu/people/directory/elfar-adalsteinsson/) and collaborate closely with Prof. [Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/) and Prof. [P. Ellen Grant](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W4dqZ7EAAAAJ).

I also did summer internships at Google and Meta, working on automated Ads bidding and large-scale video recommendation systems respectively.

Prior to MIT, I received my Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University in 2018. I also spent a summer as a research assistant at Stanford, where I was advised by Prof. [John Pauly](https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/) and Prof. [Greg Zaharchuk](https://profiles.stanford.edu/greg-zaharchuk). -->
