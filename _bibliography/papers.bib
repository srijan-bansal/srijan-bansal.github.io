    abstract = "In this paper we propose a deep learning framework for sarcasm target detection in predefined sarcastic texts. Identification of sarcasm targets can help in many core natural language processing tasks such as aspect based sentiment analysis, opinion mining etc. To begin with, we perform an empirical study of the socio-linguistic features and identify those that are statistically significant in indicating sarcasm targets (p-values in the range(0.05,0.001)). Finally, we present a deep-learning framework augmented with socio-linguistic features to detect sarcasm targets in sarcastic book-snippets and tweets.We achieve a huge improvement in the performance in terms of exact match and dice scores compared to the current state-of-the-art baseline.",

abstract = {An important component of fake news detection is to evaluate the stance, different news sources take towards the assertion. Automatic stance detection, would facilitate the process of fact checking. In this paper, we present our stance detection system which comprises of siamese adaptation of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks augmented with an attention mechanism, as siamese adaptation forces the LSTM to entirely capture the semantic differences during training, rather than supplementing the network with a more complex learner that can help resolve shortcomings in the learned representations. Our experiments on a public benchmark dataset, FakeNewsChallenge (FNC), demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. It focuses on classifying the stance of a news article body relative to a headline as agree, disagree, discuss, or unrelated.},
