    abstract = "In this paper, we present our submission to the DialDoc shared task based on the MultiDoc2Dial dataset. MultiDoc2Dial is a conversational question answering dataset that grounds dialogues in multiple documents. The task involves grounding a user{'}s query in a document followed by generating an appropriate response. We propose several improvements over the baseline{'}s retriever-reader architecture to aid in modeling goal-oriented dialogues grounded in multiple documents. Our proposed approach employs sparse representations for passage retrieval, a passage re-ranker, the fusion-in-decoder architecture for generation, and a curriculum learning training paradigm. Our approach shows a 12 point improvement in BLEU score compared to the baseline RAG model.",

abstract = {In this paper, we advance the current state-of-the-art method for debiasing monolingual word embeddings so as to generalize well in a multilingual setting. We consider different methods to quantify bias and different debiasing approaches for monolingual as well as multilingual settings. We demonstrate the significance of our bias-mitigation approach on downstream NLP applications. Our proposed methods establish the state-of-the-art performance for debiasing multilingual embeddings for three Indian languages - Hindi, Bengali, and Telugu in addition to English. We believe that our work will open up new opportunities in building unbiased downstream NLP applications that are inherently dependent on the quality of the word embeddings used.},

Identification of sarcasm targets can help in many core natural language processing tasks such as aspect based sentiment analysis, opinion mining etc. To begin with, we perform an empirical study of the socio-linguistic features and identify those that are statistically significant in indicating sarcasm targets (p-values in the range(0.05,0.001)). Finally, we present a deep-learning framework augmented with socio-linguistic features to detect sarcasm targets in sarcastic book-snippets and tweets.We achieve a huge improvement in the performance in terms of exact match and dice scores compared to the current state-of-the-art baseline.",

abstract = {An important component of fake news detection is to evaluate the stance, different news sources take towards the assertion. Automatic stance detection, would facilitate the process of fact checking. In this paper, we present our stance detection system which comprises of siamese adaptation of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks augmented with an attention mechanism, as siamese adaptation forces the LSTM to entirely capture the semantic differences during training, rather than supplementing the network with a more complex learner that can help resolve shortcomings in the learned representations. Our experiments on a public benchmark dataset, FakeNewsChallenge (FNC), demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. It focuses on classifying the stance of a news article body relative to a headline as agree, disagree, discuss, or unrelated.},
