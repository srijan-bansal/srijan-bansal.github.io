%   abstract = {Volumetric reconstruction in presence of motion is a challenging problem in medical imaging. When imaging moving targets, many modalities are limited to fast 2D imaging techniques that provide cross-sectional snapshots (2D images) of the subject with an attempt to "freeze" in-plane motion. However, inter-slice movement results in slice misalignment in 3D space, i.e., each image being an independent slice that fails to form a coherent volume for diagnosis and analysis. To this end, slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) has been proposed to reconstruct a high-quality 3D volume from misaligned 2D observations by performing inter-slice motion correction and super-resolution reconstruction. Existing SVR algorithms, however, have a limited capture range of slice motion and are time-consuming, particularly when producing high-resolution volumes. This thesis proposes a motion-robust and efficient machine learning framework for SVR, motivated by the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in assessing fetal brain development. We first introduce a slice-to-volume registration transformer that models input slices as a sequence and performs inter-slice motion correction by simultaneously predicting rigid transformations of all images in 3D space. We then reformulate the reconstruction problem using implicit neural representation, where the underlying volume is represented by a continuous function of 3D coordinates. This resolution-agnostic approach allows efficient reconstruction of high-resolution volumes. Finally, we extend this method to data that suffer from non-rigid motion by introducing an implicit motion field that captures slice-dependent deformation. These advances together enable robust and efficient 3D reconstruction and visualization in fetal MRI, benefiting diagnosis and downstream analysis. Additionally, the proposed framework has the potential for broader clinical implications in various applications that involve similar volumetric reconstruction problems.},

%   abstract = {Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with T2-weighted Half-Fourier-Acquisition Single-Shot Turbo-Spin-Echo (HASTE) sequence plays an important role in diagnosing brain abnormality. However, the quality of HASTE images routinely suffer from fetal motion which leads to image artifacts, incomplete brain coverage as well as longer scan times. To address this problem, interleaved 3D Echo-planar Imaging (EPI) navigators are acquired along with HASTE images, which can provide pose information for prospective motion correction. In this thesis, we first propose a fetal pose estimation model which detects important fetal landmarks from 3D EPI data using a deep convolution neural network. We further demonstrate its capability by applying this model to fetal motion analysis. In an attempt to improve the current fetal MRI protocol, we develop a machine learning based online decision making system for fetal MRI to improve the efficiency of acquiring high quality HASTE images for clinical diagnosis. The proposed system leverages an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) network to determine whether an acquired HASTE slice is contaminated by motion artifacts and improves image quality by re-acquisition. Evaluation on retrospective experiments and in vivo scans suggests that the proposed pipeline can improve image quality with a reasonable number of re-acquisition, potentially enabling a more efficient workflow for fetal brain MRI.},

However, existing slice-to-volume reconstruction methods are time-consuming, especially when a high-resolution volume is desired. Moreover, they are still vulnerable to severe subject motion and when image artifacts are present in acquired slices. In this work, we present NeSVoR, a resolution-agnostic slice-to-volume reconstruction method, which models the underlying volume as a continuous function of spatial coordinates with implicit neural representation. To improve robustness to subject motion and other image artifacts, we adopt a continuous and comprehensive slice acquisition model that takes into account rigid inter-slice motion, point spread function, and bias fields. NeSVoR also estimates pixel-wise and slice-wise variances of image noise and enables removal of outliers during reconstruction and visualization of uncertainty. Extensive experiments are performed on both simulated and in vivo data to evaluate the proposed method. Results show that NeSVoR achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while providing two to ten-fold acceleration in reconstruction times over the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

% abstract="Volumetric reconstruction of fetal brains from multiple stacks of MR slices, acquired in the presence of almost unpredictable and often severe subject motion, is a challenging task that is highly sensitive to the initialization of slice-to-volume transformations. We propose a novel slice-to-volume registration method using Transformers trained on synthetically transformed data, which model multiple stacks of MR slices as a sequence. With the attention mechanism, our model automatically detects the relevance between slices and predicts the transformation of one slice using information from other slices. We also estimate the underlying 3D volume to assist slice-to-volume registration and update the volume and transformations alternately to improve accuracy. Results on synthetic data show that our method achieves lower registration error and better reconstruction quality compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. Experiments with real-world MRI data are also performed to demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to improve the quality of 3D reconstruction under severe fetal motion.",

% abstract = {Purpose: Fetal brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging suffers from unpredictable and unconstrained fetal motion that causes severe image artifacts even with half-Fourier single-shot fast spin echo (HASTE) readouts. This work presents the implementation of a closed-loop pipeline that automatically detects and reacquires HASTE images that were degraded by fetal motion without any human interaction. Methods: A convolutional neural network that performs automatic image quality assessment (IQA) was run on an external GPU-equipped computer that was connected to the internal network of the MRI scanner. The modified HASTE pulse sequence sent each image to the external computer, where the IQA convolutional neural network evaluated it, and then the IQA score was sent back to the sequence. At the end of the HASTE stack, the IQA scores from all the slices were sorted, and only slices with the lowest scores (corresponding to the slices with worst image quality) were reacquired. Results: The closed-loop HASTE acquisition framework was tested on 10 pregnant mothers, for a total of 73 acquisitions of our modified HASTE sequence. The IQA convolutional neural network, which was successfully employed by our modified sequence in real time, achieved an accuracy of 85.2\% and area under the receiver operator characteristic of 0.899. Conclusion: The proposed acquisition/reconstruction pipeline was shown to successfully identify and automatically reacquire only the motion degraded fetal brain HASTE slices in the prescribed stack. This minimizes the overall time spent on HASTE acquisitions by avoiding the need to repeat the entire stack if only few slices in the stack are motion-degraded.},

% abstract="Fetal brain MRI is useful for diagnosing brain abnormalities but is challenged by fetal motion. The current protocol for T2-weighted fetal brain MRI is not robust to motion so image volumes are degraded by inter- and intra- slice motion artifacts. Besides, manual annotation for fetal MR image quality assessment are usually time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, a semi-supervised deep learning method that detects slices with artifacts during the brain volume scan is proposed. Our method is based on the mean teacher model, where we not only enforce consistency between student and teacher models on the whole image, but also adopt an ROI consistency loss to guide the network to focus on the brain region. The proposed method is evaluated on a fetal brain MR dataset with 11,223 labeled images and more than 200,000 unlabeled images. Results show that compared with supervised learning, the proposed method can improve model accuracy by about 6{\%} and outperform other state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. The proposed method is also implemented and evaluated on an MR scanner, which demonstrates the feasibility of online image quality assessment and image reacquisition during fetal MR scans.",

% abstract="The performance and diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pregnancy is fundamentally constrained by fetal motion. Motion of the fetus, which is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional imaging times, limits the set of viable acquisition techniques to single-shot imaging with severe compromises in signal-to-noise ratio and diagnostic contrast, and frequently results in unacceptable image quality. Surprisingly little is known about the characteristics of fetal motion during MRI and here we propose and demonstrate methods that exploit a growing repository of MRI observations of the gravid abdomen that are acquired at low spatial resolution but relatively high temporal resolution and over long durations (10--30 min). We estimate fetal pose per frame in MRI volumes of the pregnant abdomen via deep learning algorithms that detect key fetal landmarks. Evaluation of the proposed method shows that our framework achieves quantitatively an average error of 4.47 mm and 96.4{\%} accuracy (with error less than 10 mm). Fetal pose estimation in MRI time series yields novel means of quantifying fetal movements in health and disease, and enables the learning of kinematic models that may enhance prospective mitigation of fetal motion artifacts during MRI acquisition.",

% abstract="Fetal MRI is heavily constrained by unpredictable and substantial fetal motion that causes image artifacts and limits the set of viable diagnostic image contrasts. Current mitigation of motion artifacts is predominantly performed by fast, single-shot MRI and retrospective motion correction. Estimation of fetal pose in real time during MRI stands to benefit prospective methods to detect and mitigate fetal motion artifacts where inferred fetal motion is combined with online slice prescription with low-latency decision making. Current developments of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer a novel approach for fetal landmarks detection. In this task 15 agents are deployed to detect 15 landmarks simultaneously by DRL. The optimization is challenging, and here we propose an improved DRL that incorporates priors on physical structure of the fetal body. First, we use graph communication layers to improve the communication among agents based on a graph where each node represents a fetal-body landmark. Further, additional reward based on the distance between agents and physical structures such as the fetal limbs is used to fully exploit physical structure. Evaluation of this method on a repository of 3-mm resolution in vivo data demonstrates a mean accuracy of landmark estimation 10 mm of ground truth as 87.3{\%}, and a mean error of 6.9 mm. The proposed DRL for fetal pose landmark search demonstrates a potential clinical utility for online detection of fetal motion that guides real-time mitigation of motion artifacts as well as health diagnosis during MRI of the pregnant mother.",

% abstract="Fetal motion is the dominant challenge to reliable performance and diagnostic quality of fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The fetus can move unpredictably and rapidly, leading to severe image artifacts. Consequently, MR acquisitions are largely limited to so-called single-shot techniques in an attempt to ``freeze'' fetal motion through fast imaging, while the problem due to motion occur between slices still exists. In this work, we propose a deep learning method for fetal pose estimation from MR volumes using the paradigm of conditional generative adversarial network which consists of two networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator is responsible for estimating keypoint heatmaps from input MRI and the discriminator tries to learn the features of plausible fetal pose and distinguish ground-truth heatmaps from generated ones. With this adversarial training scheme, the generator can robustly produce realistic heatmaps for fetal pose inference. Besides, we use adaptive variance to model the difference in intensity of motion of different keypoints. Evaluation shows that the proposed method can improve the performance of pose estimation in 3D MRI, achieving quantitatively an average error of 2.64 mm and 98.31{\%} accuracy (with error less than 10 mm). The proposed method can process volumes with latency less than 300 ms, potentially enabling low-latency online tracking of fetal pose during MR scans.",

%   abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used in various clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, heart disease and neuro disorders. The use of radioactive tracer in PET imaging raises concerns due to the risk of radiation exposure. To minimize this potential risk in PET imaging, efforts have been made to reduce the amount of radio-tracer usage. However, lowing dose results in low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and loss of information, both of which will heavily affect clinical diagnosis. Besides, the ill-conditioning of low-dose PET image reconstruction makes it a difficult problem for iterative reconstruction algorithms. Previous methods proposed are typically complicated and slow, yet still cannot yield satisfactory results at significantly low dose. Here, we propose a deep learning method to resolve this issue with an encoder-decoder residual deep network with concatenate skip connections. Experiments shows the proposed method can reconstruct low-dose PET image to a standard-dose quality with only two-hundredth dose. Different cost functions for training model are explored. Multi-slice input strategy is introduced to provide the network with more structural information and make it more robust to noise. Evaluation on ultra-low-dose clinical data shows that the proposed method can achieve better result than the state-of-the-art methods and reconstruct images with comparable quality using only 0.5% of the original regular dose.}
